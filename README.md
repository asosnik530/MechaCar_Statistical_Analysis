## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically not a random amount to the mpg values in the dataset. There is a significant linear relationship because the R-squared value is greater than 0.5.  In addition the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore the slope of our linear model is not zero, which means there is significant linear relationship. The mutliple R-squared value is 0.7149, which means that roughly 71% of the MPG predictions of MechaCar prototypes will be effective when using the model.
